h3. Bootstrap a rails app with just the use of a Refinery CMS extension like +refinerycms-blog+

First, bootstrap a new rails application:

<ruby>
$ rails _4.2.6_ new blog_test_app
</ruby>

Put just the +refinerycms-blog+ in your project's Gemfile:

<ruby>
$ gem "refinerycms-blog", git: "https://github.com/refinery/refinerycms-blog"
</ruby>

This will merely pull in +refinerycms-core+ and +refinerycms-settings+ based on the current gemspec dependencies.

Then you can run:

<ruby>
$ bundle install
$ rails generate refinery:cms
</ruby>

And all the other normal set up tasks like migrations.

Now, you should have a Rails app with _only_ the Refinery CMS Blog.

Finally, start your application and enjoy the use of Refinery CMS Blog only:

<ruby>
$ rails server
</ruby>
